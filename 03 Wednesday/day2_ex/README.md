Please reflect on the following questions:

1) What is the purpose of the key value, which must be given to individual rows in a react-list?
So we can identify each row uniquely -> Keys help React identify which items have changed (added/removed/re-ordered). To give a unique identity to every element inside the array, a key is required.

2) It's recommended to use a unique value from your data if available (like an ID). How do you get a unique value in a map callback, for data without a unique id?
You can use the index parameter from .map to assign a key value.
Wherever you're lopping over data, here this.state.lists.map, you can pass second parameter function(list, index) to the callback as well and that will be its index value and it will be unique for all the items in the array.
You can use the index function of map(item,index) to assign a key value

other example could be using uuid ->
```javascript 
import React from 'react'
import uuid from 'react-uuid'

const array = ['one', 'two', 'three']

export const LineItem = item => <li key={uuid()}>{item}</li>

export const List = () => array.map(item => <LineItem item={item} />)
```

3) What is the difference(s) between state and props?
In a React component, props are variables passed to it by its parent component. State on the other hand is still variables, but directly initialized and managed by the component.
Props are read-only and state is for changing props/variables

4) For which scenarios would you use props, and for which would you use state?
I would use props when im only displaying/reading values and state when I have to change a value in components

5) Where is the only place you can set state directly as in:  this.state = {name: "Peter"};?
We use this. when are are working with Class components and would set state in the class constructor

6) How should you set state all other places?
In function components i would use the method setState() where we also have a getter and a setter -> [count, setCount]

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
